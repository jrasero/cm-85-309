Thus if you want to run the code in a cell, you would select it and click the <button class='btn btn-default btn-xs'><i class=\"fa fa-play icon-step-forward\"></i></button> button in the toolbar or the \"Cell:Run\" menu item. Similarly, to copy a cell you would select it and click the <button class='btn btn-default btn-xs'><i class=\"fa fa-copy icon-copy\"></i></button> button in the toolbar or the \"Edit:Copy\" menu item.
